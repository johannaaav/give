    <li data-brackets-id="8470">Domestic victimization is correlated with a higher rate of depression and suicidal behavior.</li>
    <li data-brackets-id="8471"> Our nation’s lack of affordable housing can dramatically reduce options for women experiencing domestic violence, trapping them in abusive situations or forcing them and their children to become homeless if they leave.
</li>
    <li data-brackets-id="8472">Despite this, domestic violence often becomes so severe that women leave their homes, even when they have no place to go. In fact, domestic violence is a major cause of homelessness in this country. </li>
