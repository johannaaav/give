             <ul> 
         <li>The National Alliance to End Homelessness states that there are 564,708 people experiencing homelessness on any given night in the US. 36,907 (6.38%) are children, 47,725 (8.33%) are veterans, and 269,991 (47.6%) are disabled and unable to work. 
                                </li>
                 <li>Many factors can contribute to a person becoming homeless: Poverty, Lack of affordable housing, Job loss, Lack of health care, Mental illness, Substance abuse, and  Domestic violence. </li>
                 <li>More families experience homelessness in the United States than in any other industrialized nation</li>
                 <li>A typical homeless family is comprised of a single mother with her two young children.</li>
                 <li>Family homelessness, once viewed as episodic and situational, has become chronic, with families accounting for 37% of the overall homeless population and 50% of the sheltered population. </li>
                 <li>A domestic violence experience is common among youth, single adults and families who become homeless and for many it is the immediate cause of their homelessness</li>
